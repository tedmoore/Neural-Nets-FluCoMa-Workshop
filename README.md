### What to expect in this workshop?

In this workshop, Ted Moore from the FluCoMa project will guide you through an exploration of some of the creative possibilities available via Neural Networks with their Max Package. Basic experience of FluCoMa is advised before joining this workshop. For example, it is recommended that you have taken the free on-demand workshop Using Machine Learning Creatively via FluCoMa In Max.

### What you'll learn

* Train neural networks to perform musical tasks
* Use training and testing data to validate trained models
* Troubleshoot the training process by adjusting neural network parameters
* Combine different types of input and output data

## Outline

### Training a Neural Network (refresher)

* classification
    - musical example: [_feed_](https://youtu.be/8QtvjMUGGB8) by [Ted Moore](https://www.tedmooremusic.com/)
    - how to train a classifier

* live visuals (category switching, like lights but just with colors or whatever)
* validation
* overfitting vs underfitting

### MLP Paramters

* hiddenlayers
* activation functions
* learnrate
* maxiter
* batchsize
* validation
* momentum

### Adjusting Parameters During Training

* musical example: [improv](https://youtu.be/qTHJaryNgBo) [Ted Moore](https://www.tedmooremusic.com/) and Fabrizio Spera (first 2 min.)
* training a regressor
* regression with control data
    - xy
    - video pixels

### Regression with Audio Analysis

* creating the datasets
* musical example: section from [_quartet_](https://youtu.be/C0FBNLy4NCM?t=150) by [Ted Moore](https://www.tedmooremusic.com/)
* predict fm parameters

### Wavetable Autoencoder

* wavetable interpolation with autoencoder
