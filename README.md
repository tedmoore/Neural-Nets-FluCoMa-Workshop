Materials for Neural Networks via FluCoMa workshop hosted by Music Hackspace

### Classification

* live visuals (category switching, like lights but just with colors or whatever)
    - musical example: _shadow_

### Regression with Control Data

* classic regressor control
* jitter camera down sampled as input
<!-- * eyeball (or other video tracking data) -->

### Regression with Audio Descriptors

* predict fm parameters
    - musical example: section from _quartet_

### Regression with Audio Samples

* wavetable interpolation with autoencoder
    - what if you feed in the original?
